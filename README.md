# DNA-sequence-analyzer
This Python script analyzes a given DNA sequence by counting the occurrences of the nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) and calculating the GC content (the percentage of G and C nucleotides).

Features:
  Counts occurrences of A, T, C, and G in the sequence
  Calculates the GC content of the DNA sequence
How to Use:
  Clone or download the project to your local machine.
  Run the script dna_analyzer.py in Python.
  Enter a DNA sequence when prompted (e.g., ATGCGATCGTAA).
  The program will output the count of each nucleotide and the GC content.
