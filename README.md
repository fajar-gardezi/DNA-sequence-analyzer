# DNA-sequence-analyzer
This Python project is designed to analyze a DNA sequence by counting the nucleotides (A, T, C, G) and calculating the GC content (the percentage of G and C nucleotides in the sequence).

## Files in This Project
1. **`dna_analyzer.py`** - The main Python script for analyzing the DNA sequence.
2. **`sequence.txt`** - A text file where you can add your DNA sequence for analysis.
3. **`README.md`** - This file, which explains the project.

## How to Use
1. Open the `sequence.txt` file and put your DNA sequence (e.g., `ATGCATGC`).
2. Run the Python script:
